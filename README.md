# StarCraft2ReplayParser
A Bot using the sc2client-api to extract information form Replays. (Only an example of how it can be done. Just works for Terran player 1)

The project was setup with Visual Studio 2017 and for the current configuration, you will need to setup the s2client-api with the cmake_vs2017.bat file. This will generate the build_vs2017 folder, which I use for library linking and protocol header includes. Don't forget to build the generated Project ;)
