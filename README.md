# StarCraft2ReplayParser
A Bot using the sc2client-api to extract information form Replays.

The project was setup with Visual Studio 2017 and for the current configuration, you will need to setup the s2client-api with the cmake_vs2017.bat file. This will generate the build_vs2017 folder, which I use for library linking and protocol header includes. Don't forget to build the generated Project ;)
